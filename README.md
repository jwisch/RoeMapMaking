Map Making for Cathy Roe
o	Here’s some stuff that I’ve done for Cathy. Code is included:
	Pulled census information on population and classified all of our participants as living in urban or rural settings (based on their 5 digit zip)
•	I then compared summary data for our participants on the basis of this urban/rural classification [ClassifyingPopulationsandComparing_UrbanRural.R]
	Made a map of the US classifying every county as urban or rural for viz
	Made a map of our participants showing where they are located
	Made a map of an individual route. It’s very pretty. Can be repeated with any other route as is helpful for viz [TrajectoryAnalysis_pickingSpecificRoutesandMakingaMap.R]
	Performed tortuosity analysis on the available breadcrumb data
•	The purpose of this is to identify how direct a route someone takes to get where they’re going. My thought was that we would be able to use these metrics to figure out of someone was lost. I left shortly after starting this project – I’m still excited about the idea but it will take some work to figure out how to do this
